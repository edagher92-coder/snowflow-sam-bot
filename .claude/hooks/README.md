# claude-defaults/hooks

Account-wide Claude Code hooks. `bootstrap.sh` copies this folder into a repo's
`.claude/hooks/` (or `~/.claude/hooks/` with `--user`), so a hook lands in every
repo/machine from one command.

## `claude-routing-classifier.ps1` — UserPromptSubmit
The **Model Routing Policy v5.1** classifier hook. On every message it classifies
the task (STAKES / EXTRACTION / HEAVY / TRIVIAL / NORMAL) and injects a `ROUTING HINT`
naming the Agent model to delegate to (or, for HEAVY non-stakes work, offloading to
Ollama Cloud via `tools/ollama_route.py`). Hardened: a deterministic money→STAKES
regex gate (fires before the model, so money never demotes even if Ollama is
down), `temperature 0` + fixed seed, single-token output, a one-time Fable-approval
gate, and fail-open on any error. Full policy:
`edagher92-coder/Claude-code-Agents` → `docs/model-routing-policy-v4.md`.

### Wire it (Windows, once) in `~/.claude/settings.json`
```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      { "hooks": [ { "type": "command",
        "command": "powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File \"%USERPROFILE%\\.claude\\hooks\\claude-routing-classifier.ps1\"" } ] }
    ]
  }
}
```
Requires an Ollama with `llama3.2:3b` pulled — local **or** the shared hub (below).
It is **not** wired into the shared `claude-defaults/settings.json` on purpose —
that file is portable, and a Windows-only PowerShell hook would error on
Linux/cloud sessions. Wire it per the snippet above; on other environments the
hook is simply absent (and would fail open regardless).

### Shared classifier hub (preferred topology)

The classifier's ~2 GB model lives ONCE on the main server; every other PC is a
thin client over Tailscale — no local models, no per-machine RAM cost.

**Hub (main server, one-time):** run Ollama with `OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0` (so it
listens on the Tailscale interface) and `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=24h` (so the
classifier stays resident for all clients); `ollama pull llama3.2:3b`. If the
hub also runs `bootstrap.ps1` locally, pass `-DedicatedGpu` — only a box that
exists to serve models hosts the full package or fills its GPU. Every other PC
defaults to the workstation profile: a single locally hosted floor model
(`llama3.2:3b`, shared by the classifier and basic tasks), with the heavy/mid
tiers on Ollama Cloud or the hub (see `tools/README.md`).

**Clients (each PC, one command):**
```powershell
.\bootstrap.ps1 -OllamaHub http://elzydlab.tail76b098.ts.net:11434
```
This persists `CLAUDE_ROUTER_OLLAMA_URL` (User env var), verifies the hub is
reachable and has the classifier model, and skips all local model installs.

Behaviour notes: against a remote hub the hook does **not** send `keep_alive`
(the server's own residency policy governs — clients can't unload the model
under each other); against localhost it sends `2m` so a single-machine setup
releases RAM between bursts. `CLAUDE_ROUTER_DISABLE_LLM_CLASSIFIER=1` remains
the zero-cost kill-switch either way, and the hook always fails open — hub
down means Claude-only routing, never a blocked prompt.
